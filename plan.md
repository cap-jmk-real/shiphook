# Deploy-runner: naming research (micro SaaS / indie / open source dev)

Focused on your niche: **micro SaaS, indie, open source, developer tools.** Goals: 2–3 syllables, pronounceable (“radio test”), works as a product + repo name, fits “webhook → pull → run script.”

---

## Naming principles (from research)

- **2–3 syllables** – Most successful dev/SaaS tools sit here (Slack, Notion, Vercel, Linear).
- **Pronounceable** – Someone hearing it once should be able to spell it.
- **.com or .dev / .io** – .com preferred; .dev and .io are common for dev tools.
- **Differentiation** – Avoid sounding like “generic deploy tool”; a distinct name helps in a crowded space.
- **Indie / OSS vibe** – Approachable, not enterprise-y; “one person can run this.”

## Name ideas (by theme)

### A. Hook + run / deploy (literal, clear)

| Name       | Syllables | Meaning              | Notes                                      |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Runhook** | 2         | Run on (web)hook     | Clear, no collision found on npm/GitHub.   |
| **Shiphook** | 2        | Ship (deploy) on hook| Same; “ship” is strong for deploy tools.   |
| **Hookrun** | 2        | Hook then run        | Slightly less natural word order.          |
| **Deployhook** | 3      | Webhook that deploys | Very explicit; a bit long for a brand.     |

**Best fit:** **Runhook** or **Shiphook** – short, clear, good for indie/OSS.

---

### B. Pull + ship (git pull → deploy)

| Name        | Syllables | Meaning           | Notes                                  |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Pullship** | 2        | Pull then ship    | Describes the flow; no collision found.|
| **Pullrun**  | 2        | Pull then run     | Generic “run” but still accurate.      |

**Best fit:** **Pullship** – strong for “pull-based deploy” and indie micro-SaaS.

---

### C. Small / focused (indie vibe)

| Name         | Syllables | Meaning          | Notes                                  |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Deploylet** | 3        | Small deploy tool| “-let” = small (applet, droplet).      |
| **Runlet**   | 2         | Small run        | Coined; could sound like “runner”.     |
| **Skiff**    | 1         | Small boat       | Nautical, “small vessel” = small tool. |
| **Winch**    | 1         | Pulls things     | Nautical, “pull” metaphor.             |

**Best fit:** **Deploylet** if you want “small deploy tool” front and center.

---

### D. Nautical / “ship” metaphor (fits “ship code”)

| Name     | Syllables | Meaning        | Notes                                   |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Ferry**  | 2        | Ferries code   | Friendly; check Ferry (app) collision.  |
| **Berth**  | 1        | Where you dock | Short; might be obscure for some.      |
| **Moor**   | 1        | Moor the ship  | Very short; “moor” is less obvious.     |
| **Winch**  | 1        | Pulls/cranks   | Strong “pull” metaphor.                 |

Use only if you like the metaphor and have checked trademarks.

---

### E. Action / dispatch

| Name       | Syllables | Meaning   | Notes                          |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Dispatch** | 2       | Send off  | Clear; many “Dispatch” products. |
| **Crank**  | 1         | Crank it  | Indie, “just crank the deploy”. |
| **Rev**    | 1         | Rev engine| Very short; might be vague.     |

**Dispatch** is strong but crowded; **Crank** is distinctive for indie.

---

## npm availability (checked)

**Taken (avoid unscoped):** `crank` (Yahoo, version/changelog), `hookrun` (telecom automation).

**Available (404 on npm):** Use any of these for an unscoped package so users can `npm i -g <name>` with no scope.

| Name           | Syllables | Vibe / meaning                          |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **runhook**    | 2         | Run on webhook — literal, clear.        |
| **pullship**   | 2         | Pull (git) then ship — fits pull-deploy. |
| **shiphook**   | 2         | Ship on hook — deploy + webhook.       |
| **pullrun**    | 2         | Pull then run — simple.                 |
| **shiprun**    | 2         | Ship/run — short.                       |
| **webhook-run**| 3         | Webhook then run — very explicit.      |
| **run-deploy** | 2         | Run deploy — clear.                     |
| **pull-deploy**| 2         | Pull then deploy.                       |
| **crank-deploy** | 2       | Keep “Crank” in the name, unscoped.    |

**Chosen:** **Shiphook** — product and npm package name. Unscoped `shiphook` is available on npm.

## Recommended shortlist (for your niche)

1. **Runhook** – “Run on webhook.” Clear, 2 syllables, no collision found. Works well for OSS and docs: “Runhook runs your deploy when GitHub pings.”
2. **Pullship** – “Pull (git) then ship.” Fits pull-based deploy and micro-SaaS; 2 syllables.
3. **Shiphook** – “Ship on hook.” Same clarity as Runhook, with a stronger “deploy” feel.
4. **Deploylet** – “Small deploy tool.” Good if you want to stress “lightweight / one-box” for indie.
5. **Crank** – “Crank the deploy.” Single syllable, memorable, very indie; less literal.

## Suggested next step

- **Primary pick:** **Runhook** or **Pullship** – both fit “webhook → pull → run,” are easy to say and spell, and suit micro-SaaS/indie/OSS.
- **Check:** Domain (runhook.dev, pullship.io, etc.), GitHub org/repo, npm, and a quick trademark search in “software / developer tools” before locking the name in the plan or code.

Use one of these as the project name in `deploy-runner-project-plan.md` (e.g. “Runhook” or “Pullship”) and keep the plan doc as the single source of truth for the separate repo.
